# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It is a simple recipe website that demonstrates my understanding of basic HTML structure, linking, and file organization.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:
- Setting up a project directory structure.
- Writing basic HTML for web pages.
- Linking pages together using `<a>` tags.
- Organizing files for better readability.

This is a stepping stone in my web development journey!
